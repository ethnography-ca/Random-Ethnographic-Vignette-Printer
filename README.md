# Random Ethnographic Vignette Printer

The **Random Ethnographic Vignette Printer** is an open-access, interactive tool designed to support the teaching and practice of ethnographic writing. It makes engaging with ethnographic vignettes more **playful, reflective, and tactile** by combining:

- A curated, open-access database of ethnographic excerpts  
- A graphical user interface for random vignette selection  
- A thermal receipt printer for tangible printouts  

Each vignette is paired with bibliographic citation, a reflection prompt, and a QR code linking to short ethnographic writing lessons.

## How It Works
1. Launch the program.  
2. Choose vignette length (short / medium / long).  
3. Decide whether to include a reflection question.  
4. Choose between **print** or **on-screen preview**.  
5. A vignette is randomly selected and displayed/printed.  

Printouts include:  
- Vignette excerpt  
- Bibliographic citation  
- Reflection question  
- Linked lesson + QR code  

Randomization ensures variety and avoids repetition until the pool resets.
